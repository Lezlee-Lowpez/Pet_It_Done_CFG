Pet It Done is an application designed to merge the enjoyment and fun of gaming with the practicality of a to-do list. 
If you know you need an extra dose of urgency or that hit of dopamine you experience when gaming that traditional to-do lists seem to lack, then Pet It Done is your perfect productivity companion. In Pet It Done, you have a lovable virtual pet that relies on you to meet its needs. As you complete your tasks, you'll collect the necesary items to help make your pet happy again. It's a new, adorable, and rewarding way to stay motivated and productive.

With Pet It Done, you no longer have to worry about overwhelming task lists that seem to never reach an end. Our application takes the overwhelming feeling of trying to complete too much by restricting the user to THREE main tasks that they need to complete to help their virtual pet thrive. You'll never look at a To-Do list the same.

## Overview ‚òÅÔ∏è

---
This application aims to addresses the common challenge of lacking motivation when it comes to completing tasks. Most people struggle with finding the motivation to finish their own chores/tasks that they need to complete for the day. Our objective is to assist users in reaching their goals and helping them have fun along the way.

## Considerations üí≠

---
Accessibility: Our mobile application has been designed with accessibility at the forefront, to ensure an inclusive user experience. We have considered visual, motor, and cognitive accessibility needs. We used clear and legible fonts and choose color schemes that promoted an enjoyable user experience. Large, easy tappable buttons for motor accessibility were some of the other measures we took to promote accesibility throughtout our application. The language used is clear and concise for individuals with cognitive impairments.

Task List Design: The task list feature has been designed to provide users with a manageable and fun experience. Users are limited to three tasks per day, ensuring they are not overwhelmed. Upon task completion, users have the opportunity to collect items that contribute to their pet's happiness, which helps the user grow a sense of responsibility and motivation.

Trade-offs: Throughout the development of the app, we made certain trade-offs due to time constraints. For example, we did not incorporate the option for users to choose their own pet, and we simplified the way we measured pet happiness for failing to complete tasks. These trade-offs were necessary to ensure the development of the application within the given timeframe.
