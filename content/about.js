PetItDone is a mobile app 
that allows you to create a 
to-do list, and as you 
complete your tasks you 
get to meet the needs of 
your digipet. 

Having your digipet to look 
after adds a unique sense 
of fun and urgency to 
completing tasks, and our 
three-task a day limit mean 
that youâ€™ll never be 
overwhelmed by your to-do 
list again. Just three tasks 
a day, as big or small as 
you choose, and your little
pet will be all smiles. We will 
send you notifications when 
your pets needs change, to 
give you the little push that 
we all need sometimes.
